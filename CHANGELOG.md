# 0.7.2 (April 27, 2016)

## Bugfixes

- Reinstated some `PageHeader` padding that was removed in 0.7.1.

# 0.7.1 (April 27, 2016)

## Other Changes

- Adjusted the `PageHeader` CSS to work with React 15, which no longer generates `span` wrappers for text interpolation and simply includes text nodes delimited by comment nodes.

# 0.7.0 (April 25, 2016)

## Breaking Changes

- Removed `bootstrap-loader` in favor of just using the plain `bootstrap` package. Including the relevant peer dependencies is no longer necessary. This fixes an issue where a `.bootstraprc` file was required to disable Bootstrap JavaScript to avoid an implicit dependency on jQuery.

# 0.6.0 (April 18, 2016)

## Breaking Changes

- Removed an overly specific global `font-size: small` rule that caused significant problems when attempting to create text styles.

# 0.5.0 (April 4, 2016)

## Breaking Changes

- The way `MenuBar` components are structured has been modified to remove the (previously undeclared) dependency on `react-router`. Instead of providing a link URL via `to` props, a HTML anchor element must be provided as a child. For example, given the following style from previous versions:

   ```js
   <MenuBarItem to="/">Home</MenuBarItem>
   ```

   Starting in version 0.5.0, the link must be passed as a child component:

   ```js
   <MenuBarItem><Link to="/">Home</Link></MenuBarItem>
   ```

   As a side-effect, this allows ordinary HTML anchor elements to be used in place of react-router `Link` components.

   Also, the `MenuBar` component’s API has been altered to accept an optional `onTitleClick` callback prop instead of directly using `Link` within its implementation.

# 0.4.4 (April 1, 2016)

## New Features

- Added support for modal components in `visual-stack/lib/components/Modal`.

# 0.4.3 (March 28, 2016)

## Breaking Changes

- `ActionButton` `additionalClassNames` prop has been changed to `className`. Change the prop accordingly.

# 0.4.2 (March 25, 2016)

## Other Changes

- `Row` can now accept props like id, onClick, and so on.

# 0.4.1 (March 24, 2016)

## Other Changes

- Added a proper margin to the bottom of the `PageHeader` component that matches the original source component.

# 0.4.0 (March 24, 2016)

## New Features

- Added various form components, including `Form`, `FormGroup`, `Input`, `Label`, and `Legend`.

# 0.3.1 (March 23, 2016)

## New Features

- Added `ActionButton` component to be used by `Toolbar` for actions within a List Toolbar.

# 0.3.0 (March 23, 2016)

## Breaking Changes

- The `ExpandedRow` component has been removed in favor of supporting an `expansion` prop on the `Row` component. All code should still work after replacing all instances of `ExpandedRow` with `Row`.

## Bugfixes

- The `react` dependency is now properly listed as a peer dependency. This should not break any existing code, but it may cause version conflicts if using an old version of React.

# 0.2.1 (March 23, 2016)

## Bugfixes

- Click events’ default actions are now properly suppressed when clicking on dropdown menu items, preventing the fragment from being reset.

# 0.2.0 (March 23, 2016)

## New Features

- Enhanced the `MenuBar` component to support right-aligned menu items and (stateless) dropdown menus. The `leftItems` prop can be used *instead of* using passing child elements for consistency with the new `rightItems` prop, but this is optional.
